# Curation-Appendix
In Main_model_results_xlsx, the worksheet IndexMap reports the mapping between parameter indices and covariate names for all model components. The model column identifies the relevant regression (outcome beta, treatment assignment gamma, state transition alpha, or retweet outcome mu_R). The index column gives the position of the parameter within the corresponding model-specific coefficient vector or matrix, with indices restarting at 1 for each model. The variable column lists the associated covariate. For parameters indexed as [i,j] or [i,j,k], i refers to the latent stratum (or state) and the final index corresponds to the covariate index; the mapping from that index to the variable name is provided in this worksheet. Variables are ordered exactly as they appear in the design matrices used for estimation.
